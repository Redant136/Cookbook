6 Servings
p. 34
sort=polenta crisps
#### Ingredients
##### Polenta crisps
- 5 cups water
- salt
- 1 cup  coarse-grain polenta
##### Sauce
- 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 1 clove garlic minced
- 4 large olive oil packed anchovies
- 2 tablespoon capers, rinsed and finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh flat leaf parsley
- freshly ground pepper to taste
- vegetables for deep-frying
#### Instructions
1. To make polenta crisps, in a deep saucepan over high heat, bring the water to a boil and salt lightly. Reduce the heat to low and cook stirring continuously with a wooden spoon, for about 40 minutes. The polenta is ready when it becomes quite thick and pulls away from the sides of the pan as you stir it.
2. Oil the bottom and sides of a 9 by 12 inch baking pan. Pour the polenta into the prepared pan, smoothing the surface with the back of a spoon. Let the polenta cool for a few hours or overnight in the refrigerator.
3. Invert the polenta onto a cutting board. Cut into 2 by 1 inch rectangles.
4. To make the sauce, in a saucepan over low heat, warm the olive oil. Add the garlic and saut√© until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the anchovy fillets and, using a wooden spoon, break them apart in the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly, about 6 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, capers and parsley, season with pepper, raise the heat to medium and cook uncovered for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, cover and set aside.
5. Lay a few sheets of paper towels near the stove and top with a wire rack. Select a large, deep frying pan, preferably of cast iron. Pour vegetable oil to a depth of 3 inches into the pan and heat to 350F on a deep frying thermometer. Working in batches, fry the polenta, turning once, until crisp and golden on both sides, about 10 minutes total. Using a slotted utensil, transfer the slices to the wire rack to drain. Keep warm in a low oven until serving.
6. Arrange the hot polenta crisps on a warmed serving platter and top each slice with a teaspoon of the sauce. Serve immediately.
