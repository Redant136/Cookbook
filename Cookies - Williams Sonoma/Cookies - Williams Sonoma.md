p. 13
sort=shortbread
#### Ingredients
- 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar plus 1 tablespoon for sprinkling
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
#### Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 300F. Have ready and ungreased 9 inch square baking pan
2. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on high speed, cream the butter until fluffy and pale yellow. Add the confectioners' sugar and the 1/4 cup granulated sugar and continue beating until the mixture is no longer gritty when rubbed between you finger and thumb. Beat in the vanilla.
3. Sift the flour and salt together onto a sheet of waxed paper. Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and mix on low speed or stir with a wooden spoon until just blended.
4. Using floured fingertips, press the dough evenly into the pan. Sprinkle evenly with the 1 tablespoon granulated sugar.
5. Bake the shortbread until the edges are golden, about 1 hour. Remove the pan from the oven and immediately use a thin sharp knife to cut the shortbread into strips 3 inches by 1 inch. Use a toothpick or the tines of a fork to decorate the shortbread with a pattern of dots. Let the strips cook in the pan on a wire rack for 30 minutes before transferring them to the rack to cool completely.
### Madeleines
2 Douzens
p. 21
#### Ingredients
- 1 1/4 cups cake flour
- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs
- 2 large egg yolks
- 3/4 cups sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Grated zest of 1/2 lemon
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled
#### Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 375F. Generously brush a standard 12 mold madeleine pan with melted butter and lightly dust with flour, tapping out any excess. (If using a nonstick pan, there is no need to dust it with flour, but brushing with butter will add flavor).
2. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt together into a bowl. Set the dry ingredients aside.
3. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat the whole eggs, egg yolks and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the vanilla and lemon zest and beat until well combined.
4. Using a rubber spatula, fold the flour mixture into the egg mixture until blended. Add the melted butter and fold until well combined.
5. Drop the batter by heaping tablespoonfuls into the madeleine molds. Fill each mold three-fourth full. Bake until golden brown and springy to the touch. About 15 minutes.
6. Immediately invert the pan onto a wire rack. If necessary, use a knife to pry the cookies gently from the pan. Let the cookies cool completely on the rack. Wipe out the pan, let cool, brush with the melted butter, dust with flour and repeat with the remaining batter.
## Cookies
### Black and white cookies
p. 34
#### Ingredients
- 2 cups all purpose flour
- 1/2 cup sugar
- pinch of salt
- 1 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
- 3 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch process cocoa powder
#### Instructions
1. Lightly grease 2 baking sheets or line with parchment paper. Set aside
2. In a food processor, combine the flour, sugar and salt. Add the butter pieces in 2 additions, pulsing after each addition, until the mixture has the consistency of coarse crumbs. Add the egg yolk and vanilla and pulse until the dough holds together.
3. Divide the dough in half. Transfer one half to a lightly floured work surface and knead in the cocoa until incorporated.
4. Lightly dust the work surface and a rolling pin with flour. Roll out each dough half into a 3 by 9 inch rectangle, 1/2~3/4 inch thick; trim the edges to even out. Place each rectangle on a large baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until well chilled, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, beat the whole egg until blended. Set aside.
5. Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Using a sharp knife, cut each rectangle into 4 strips about 3/4 inches wide. Arrange 2 chocolate strips and 2 plain strips in a checkerboard pattern, brushing the beaten egg between the strips and gently pressing together. Repeat with the remaining dough. Wrap in plastic and use a knife to square off the edges of each block. Refrigerate until well chilled, about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350F.
6. Remove the block from the refrigerator, unwrap and cut each crosswise into slices 1/4 inch thick. Place 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared sheets and bake until they feel firm when lightly pressed, about 15 minutes. Let the cookies sit on the baking sheets for 2 minutes, before using a spatula to transfer them to wire racks to cool completely.

#### Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350F. Have ready 2 ungreased baking sheets. Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt onto a sheet of waxed paper; set aside.
2. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on high speed, cream the butter until fluffy and pale yellow. Add the granulated and brown sugars and continue beating until the mixture is no longer gritty when rubbed between your fingers and thumb. Add the egg and vanilla and beat on low speed until blended, occasionally stopping the mixer and scraping down the sides of the bowl with  a rubber spatula as needed.
3. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and mix on low speed or stir with a wooden spoon just until blended. Add the chocolate chips and the walnuts mixing or stirring just until blended. 
4. With dampened hands, shape the dough into 1 inch balls or drop by rounded tablespoons onto the baking sheets, spacing the cookies about 2 inches apart.
5. Bake the cookies until golden brown around the edges, about 12 minutes. Let the cookies cool briefly on the pans on wire racks before transferring them to the racks to cool completely.
