- 2 stalks celery
- 2 leeks, white and light green parts only, halved lengthwise
- 10 cups water
##### For the risotto:
- 3 pounds fresh cardoons
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 1 cup cold water
- ⅓ cup extra virgin olive oil
- ⅓ cup finely chopped onion
- 1¾ cups Jtalian vice Vialone Nano, Carnaroli, or arborio)
- ½ cup dry white wine
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
- ½ ounce white truffle, shaved
#### Instructions
##### MAKE THE BROTH: 
1. Put all of the ingredients in a large pot. If the water doesn't cover the solids, add more. Cover the pot and bring the broth to a boil over high heat. 
2. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, partially covered, for an hour. Remove the solids by pouring the broth through a strainer. 
3. Return the broth to the pot and keep it at a simmer to use in the risotto. 
##### MAKE THE RISOTTO: 
1. Remove and discard the tough outer ribs of the cardoons. Remove the strings from the remaining ribs with a vegetable peeler. Cut the ribs into 2-inch pieces and put them into a bowl with water and the lemon juice. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 
2. Mix the flour with the cold water until it has dissolved and add it to the pot. Strain the cardoons and add them to the boiling water. Cook them for about 30 minutes or until tender, then drain them in a colander. Cut them into ½-inch slices. 
3. Put 2 cups of sliced cardoons (reserve the rest) in a blender or processor with 1 cup of the vegetable broth. Blend or pulse until they make a puree. 
4. In a large, heavy casserole over medium heat, warm half the olive oil. Add the onion and sauté until it is translucent, about 5 minutes. 
5. Stir in the rice with a wooden spoon until it is hot and completely coated with off and onion. Stir in the wine.
6. When the liquid evaporates, stir in the reserved sliced cardoons. 
7. Add a ladle of simmering broth to the rice and stir. When the liquid has been absorbed, add another ladle of broth. Continue in this way, letting the liquid absorb before adding another ladleful, and stirring frequently, for about 12 minutes. (You will probably use 6 cups total.) 
8. Then continue with the ladle-at-a-time process, only using the cardoon puree. When the mixture gets too thick to cook without sticking, use the broth again. 
9. You may not need all of the cardoon puree or all of the broth; conversely, you may need to add extra hot water, depending on the shape of your pan, the heat, the rice, etc. 
10. The risotto should be done after it cooks for a total of 18 to 20 minutes: Each grain will be soft on the outside, with a slightly chewy center. 
11. Remove the risotto from the heat and beat in the butter, the remaining olive oil, and the grated Parmesan. 
12. Stir vigorously to make the risotto creamy and all'onda (wavy). If it seems too dry. adjust the texture with a bit more broth. Season with salt and pepper, spoon onto individual plates, and top each serving with shaved truffle. Serve immediately.

### Apple Roll
6 Servings
p. 218
#### Ingredients
- 2 1/4 sups flour
- 1 egg
- 12 tablespoons butter, softened to room temperature
- 1/4 cup hot mild 
- Pinch of salt
- 2 pounds tart apples, such as Italian Renette or Granny Smith
- 5/8 cups sugar
- 1/2 cup raisins, soaked in warm water for 30 minutes or until plump
- 3/4 cup pine nuts
- 3/4 cup walnut halves
- Grated zest of 1 lemon
#### Instructions
1. Place the flour on a clean work surface. Make a well in the center. Put the egg, 2 tablespoons of butter, half the milk and the salt in the well.
2. Using a fork, pull some of the flour into the center and mix it in with the egg. Continue pulling a little flour into the center and mixing it together until it is all incorporated into a smooth dough.
3. Add more milk, a spoonful at a time, if there is not enough liquid to absorb the flour. Wrap the dough in plastic and let it rest while you are preparing the apples
4. Feel, core and cut the apples into 8 wedges each. Sprinkle them with 2 tablespoons of the sugar and let them rest.
5. Roll out the dough with a rolling pin on a clean surface dusted with flour, into a circular shape about 1/8 inch thick.
6. Spread the apples out evenly on the dough. Squeeze the raisins to release excess water and strew them over the apples, along with the pine nuts, walnuts and lemon zest.
7. Sprinkle all but 1/4 cup of the remaining sugar over the top. Then melt 6 tablespoons of the butter and drizzle it evenly over all.
8. Preheat the oven to 300F. Grease a cookie sheet with butter.
9. Beginning at one end, roll this mixture loosely into a thick log. Bring the end together to form a ring. 
10. Using both hands, spread out to act like spatulas, gently lift the roll onto the sheet, then dot it with the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter and sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar over it.
11. Put the roll in the preheated over. When the roll forms a dry crust on the outside (after 30 minutes), if the apples have not released their juices into the bottom of the pan, add enough water to cover the bottom of the pan by 1/8 inch.
12. Using a spoon, baste the roll every 10 minutes with the liquid in the bottom of the pan to caramelize the surface.
13. The roll is cooked when the surface is crisp and golden brown, about another 30 minutes.
14. As soon as the roll is done, remove it from the pan immediately: otherwise it will stick to the bottom. To remove the roll, cover it with a lid and invert it so that it is sitting upside down on the lid; then perform the same inversion trick to get it right side up on a serving platter.

3. Add a little cream to the unsweetened cocoa and mix with a spoon to make a paste, then thin the paste by adding the rest of the cream, mixing continually with a whisk.
4. Add the cocoa cream to the melted chocolate and blend thoroughly. Let the mixture cool in the refrigerator until cold, about 1 hour.
5. Beat the espresso into the mixture with an electric mixer or an egg beater, keeping the bowl cold by setting it in an ice water bath.
6. When it is well blended, smooth, and creamy, dust your hands with the sweet cocoa powder and use them to form the mixture into small (1/-inch) balls, keeping your hands dusted the whole time and placing the balls in little paper confectioner's cups.

#### Instructions
##### Make the dough
1. In a large mixing bowl, mix the yeast with the warm water, 1 tablespoon of the warm milk, the flour and the salt. Mix in the eggs one at a time.
2. Knead the dough for 7 minutes, until it is smooth and elastic (you can do this in a processor by pulsing).
3. Knead in the rest of the milk then the sugar and last the butter. Cover the dough with a towel and set it in a warm place to rise for 30 minutes.
4. Preheat the over to 375F. Grease a 7 inch savarin mold with butter and then dust it with flour. Transfer the dough to the savarin mold and let it rise again for 30 minutes more, by which time the dough should have risen nearly to the rim.
5. Pu the savarin in the preheated oven and bake for 25 minutes or until the top is golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
##### Make the orange and caramel
1. In a small saucepan, squeeze the juice from 3 of the oranges and add it to the tea along with half the sugar and half of the kirsch (or rum). 
2. Bring the mixture to a boil on low heat and cook until the mixture caramelizes to a golden brown and thickens into a syrup, 15 to 20 minutes.
3. While the mixture is simmering, peel the remaining oranges, section them and peel the membrane from each section with a sharp paring knife.
4. In a separate saucepan over low heat, dissolve the remaining sugar with the remaining kirsch (or rum) and the water.
5. When the sugar has dissolved, remove it from the heat and let it cool. When it reaches room temperature, add the peeled orange segments and let them soak for at least half and hour.
6. When the baba is done, remove it from the oven and turn it out onto a serving platter. 
7. Drizzle the caramelized syrup all over it. Lift the orange segment from their soaking liquid and place them in the hole in the center of the baba, then drizzle the soaking liquid over the baba.
